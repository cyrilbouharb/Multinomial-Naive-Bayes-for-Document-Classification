# README for COMPSCI 589 Homework 2

## Overview
This homework involves the implementation of a multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm for classifying movie reviews as positive or negative, using the IMDB Large Movie Review dataset developed by Maas et al. in 2011. The development was carried out on Google Colab Plus and subsequently converted to a Python script for submission. This document provides instructions to replicate the experiments and analyses.

## Environment Setup
Before running the scripts, please ensure you have a Python 3 environment set up with the necessary libraries installed. 

## Note for TAs
The original code was developed in Google Colab plus, it has been converted into a Python script for submission as requested. To review the code's logic and the execution flow please see the notebook (.ipynb) version because this is how I was working on it, and it's easier to understand. I answer the questions in the notebook and write the code too. I also won't submit the datasets on gradescope. In case you want to test my code please make sure you have the dataset downloaded. Considering the notebook's structure, breaking down the code into separate Python scripts for each question may facilitate a clearer understanding of the implementations.

### My code
**File Name: 'submission.py' or the notebook version for interactive visualization 'submission.ipynb'.**<br />
The 'submission.py' script encompasses all six questions of the homework, including plots, printed results, and analytical answers. The notebook version is recommended for a step-by-step walkthrough of the logic and implementation. <br />
To run this script, use the following command in your terminal: **python submission.py**
